- replace `chunk size` parameter with `memory`, denoting the amount of memory being dedicated to Dask
- table objects should be descriptions of the final table columns, not process descriptions
- documents should go to `output/documents/` not `/output`
- a count of repeated column groups can be achieved with `dataframe.groupby(columns).size().reset_index(name="Column Name")` where `Column Name` is the name of the added column with counts
